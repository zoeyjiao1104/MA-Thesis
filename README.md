`Reddit_data.ipynb` is a notebook for scraping Reddit data from the following subreddits **lactoseintolerant** , **lactoseintolerance** , **milkmemes** , **AncestryDNA** , **23AndMe** , **MyHeritage**. All posts and comments are scraped from each subreddits. For the first three subreddits, the posts are combined into a dataframe and the comments are combined into a dataframe, which I named as **lactose_df_posts** and **lactose_df_comments** because these three subreddits are related to lactose. The other three subreddits are combined into another dataframe (posts and comments separated), named as **genome_df_posts** and **genome_df_comments** for they are related to genetics.
