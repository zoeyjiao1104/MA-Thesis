“You cannot know where you are going unless you know where you are from.” ~ Amie DiDia Farace


Chapter 50
 
At 50 years old, I finally connect the dots of ""who I am and where I come from"", at least biologically.

Born in NY and moved to South Dakota as an infant far away from the multi-cultured Long Island. I grew up with the understanding that my older brother and myself shared a father, who’s name “Schulz” was on my birth certificate and he was back in New York. As the legend went, he went out for milk and never came home. 

Growing up in South Dakota for me was not a great experience. My mother worked very hard as a single mother and did her best raising, now 3, kids on her own. We lived very modestly in a small trailer. For me, as one with dark hair and darker skin in South Dakota, I was the victim of much racial bullying. As it turns out I am actually very grateful for that as it led me to the sport of Boxing and Boxing saved my life. That’s a whole other blog! 



I joined the Army National Guard at 17 and moved to Florida with a friend at 20, far away from South Dakota and in my own paradise. 

Always curious as to why my brother who was just 18 months older than myself were so unalike until my grandfathers funeral in 2001 when I was told by a close family member, who had a few too many glasses of wine, that Schulz was not my Father and my mother had an affair with an Italian guy on Long Island.... hmmmm this started making sense.  

My son Jordan Schulz was born in 2003 and with the absence of a father in my life that was incredible motivation to be a huge part of his, regardless of the fact his mother and I were never married and separated when he was just an infant. 

So the curiosity remained for many years, and for many years I, little by little, gathered tiny bits of information within my own investigation.  When I met my amazing wife and of course told her of how this mystery has affected me over the years, she surprised me with an Ancestry DNA test for Christmas 2016. With a simple drop of saliva into a tube, off in the mail, it went. We patiently awaited the results for 2 long months....and what do you know, I’m 50% Italian. And sorry to report to those from my childhood in South Dakota who knew me, 0% Mexican.. imagine that!


I wanted to finally address this with my mother who was in Florida on vacation so I sat her down with the results of the DNA test.. She again strongly insisted Schulz was my father. For a second opinion, we then got the 23 ;Me DNA test and it confirmed I was 44% Italian.

So last year during another visit from my mother we decided that my wife and I both would try and sit my mother down and have the conversation with her again. And that changed everything. After 49 years the secret finally started to see light.

My mother is a very strong and proud woman and finally admitted that while she was just 19 years old she had an affair with a married man and there “could be a chance” he fathered me. She shared some details about him including his name. Wow, after 49 years to finally hear the truth and attach a name to the mystery.

The investigation went into high gear as did my excitement and anxiety levels. 
Since we had his name I emailed everyone on Ancestry DNA and 23 ;Me that I was connected genetically to on my Italian side. And for whatever reason emailed one connection who had a VERY Italian last name. And she, although not connected biologically on my Italian side, happens to help people find people for a living. And with the little information I gave her, what do you know, she was able to locate him in California! 

Wow. Here I am at age 49, for the first time seeing my Biological Father’s face. We wanted to reach out to him, with very little expectations other than basically connecting the dots of who I am and where I came from biologically. We decided to call his business and ask anonymously about my mother and 1968. We made one call got the voicemail and hung up quickly. At this point, it’s still not 100% confirmed he is the guy.

Literally 2 days later I got an email from one of my geo connections on 23 ;Me as a reply to my “Seeking my Biological Father email”. Hi, Johnny, my name is Trent, I think we can help each other out here is my phone number call me. When I looked closer to our connection on 23 ;Me he was listed as my nephew!

We were excited to call him and when we did he confirmed my GeoDad was his grandfather! He wanted to help me connect with him but also wanted to help protect his grandmother who I learned was the same woman he was married to 50 years ago when I was conceived, with 3 grown children, aka my half-siblings in California. He also, of course, wanted to protect how the rest of the family would hear this news, after all. I am a bit of a bombshell of news! I learned he was very much a family man, with a close-knit beautiful family and neither one of us, wanted to disrupt that or cause any unnecessary heartache. 

We decided a letter would be in order and he would deliver it with the hopes of a positive response to a request to chat. After many drafts, a very honest letter was sent assuring him I had no ill will and low expectations but also let him know he can have comfort in knowing I am alive and doing very well, with a loving wife and kids, and I am proud to be a sum of my experiences. I also included a recent photo of our family. His grandson would be the one to hand deliver this letter to ensure it was not discovered by anyone else but him. 


About a week later....... the phone rang... “HEY JOHNNY!” Said the man on the other line, and at 50 years old I spoke to my biological father for the first time. :)

For the past four months, we have spoken numerous times. He mentioned he did know about me and has followed me and my boxing career online, he was a former boxer, duh! He also saw my family and son etc, but was hesitant to reach out and was very grateful that I tracked him down, and has been in constant contact. He has since had a conversation with his close family including his wife about me, and was given forgiveness and in turn, we now all speak together on the phone, she is a very sweet woman.

He is in Huntington Beach California and the next logical step is for us to officially meet.
So as I write this we are 36,181 feet in the air and just crossed the California state line. 

This is the day  I will meet my Biological Father.


Chapter 50.6

California! We stuck the landing at LAX! Los Angeles is the city I dreamt of as a youth and teen in South Dakota. I always felt I belonged here for a rock star destiny during the glorious Hair Metal Rock years 1981-1989. 

We drove from LAX to Manhattan Beach for a deep breath and quick view. Wow what a beautiful view and tranquil moment with my Rock. A perfect moment of clarity before we made our way to Orange to connect the aforementioned biological dot.

Those closest to me know about this story and as this trip grew closer each and everyone had a similar feel good happy reaction with a sincere wish of happiness and of course they wanted an update.  Telling this story has been therapeutic, and inspiring as the look in one's eyes after telling, gave me an absolute feeling of joy and gratitude knowing I am living out yet a true life happy ending story in a world filled with a whole lot of otherwise. 

So on the 5 hour flight to LAX I wrote out the story with the idea to post it to update my circle of friends and was hoping to bring hope to those who may be in a similar situation. Just before we drove to Manhattan beach I posted part one of my journey online. As we were leaving the beach I checked the post and was absolutely blown away from how our story touched so many people in such a beautiful and positive way! It was just the final nudge of confidence and support I needed for the drive to go meet my father for the very first time.

I can only compare the feeling with the day of a fight. The nerves in my stomach are on a clock, counting down until that moment of bravery, my mind is working overtime to calmly process the many racing thoughts, emotions, and anxieties, ...doubts. And my soul, my warrior's soul is standing proud ....holding it all together to do what I have always done whenever I was faced with adversity in my life ...breath, smile and walk through ... as the quote always went in my head.

About a block before we turned down Cully Street and as I was getting my final pep talk from my Rock I abruptly turned down a side street for a final gathering of sorts before I did what I always hoped and dreamed I would., look my father in the eyes. 

We pulled up to his driveway where he proudly had an American and US Navy flag flying in front. I walked to the front door and it swung open and I was about to take my first step on the porch and at that time I locked eyes with my Father,..It felt like I was looking at myself and could see generations deep at the same exact time. 


We embraced each other and said almost at the same time, I am so happy to see you. At which moment I seen the beautiful soul standing next to him just as she has for the last 58 years and last 40 in this home. She had a huge smile on her face and her arms wide open for an embrace! 

We spent the next several hours talking, laughing, eating and catching up on some great Italian culture. The more we talked the more the two of them reminded me of my beautiful Italian Wife and myself. It was a perfect initial introduction and we were excited to come back the following day as they invited the immediate family over to meet us.

Through this discovery I have gained 2 half brothers and a sister whom will be there at the welcome party, along with her children, all who were very..., let’s say excited and anxious to meet me. Oh very rightfully so, after all I am a product of infidelity that was a direct heartbreaking effect to their most precious commodity, their loving mother. 

Day two was another anxious day as I was not completely sure how I would be perceived by the family. I have, more than once, tried to picture myself in their shoes and what it felt like as a sibling with natural protective instincts for their beloved mother. I was certain I was going to be resented and judged. Credit my loving wife yet again with another supportive, I am your rock best friend talk.

We arrived first and everyone started arriving in perfect sequence to allow time for a quick initial visit with each of them. We were met with loving sincere hugs from everyone and then the food came out!! 

Forget about it!!!! Meatballs, sausage, Baked Ziti, Eggplant, Chicken Marcela, Salad, Rose’s Famous Chocolate Ricotta Cheesecake, Vanilla Raspberry Cake, Hand Stuffed Cannolis and a table filled with a loving Italian Family!! 🇮🇹

It was truly an amazing day filled with laughter, forks clinking on plates, hugs and some great stories, our family history! It was a wonderful feast where everyone sat at the same table for nearly 10 hours fully engaged in family. From my fathers' brother and lifelong friend Uncle Eddie to my half brothers and sister and their children. It was so comforting and it felt like we have known them all our whole life. We were genuinely accepted into the family with open arms.

Each one of the siblings took a moment to privately accept me unconditionally to the family which made my heart melt and most of all their mother, who bless her heart spent the day as all old school Italian women do cooking and serving, she told me she had a place for me in her heart, was able to forget about the past and from now on she now has 3 boys, welcome to the family.

I am very grateful for my current position and proud to say I am a product of my amazing experiences in life. I am exactly where I am supposed to be. 

I love how life is always teaching us and how we can always grow like a tree. Until Jordan and the responsibility of being a father, I felt purposeless.. he saved me and lead me into boxing where I met the most influential people in my life. 

Until I met Amie I felt lost, ...one lost soul swimming in a fishbowl. She taught me about myself, showed me what a best friend is and what love is all about. Without her selfless loving ways and positive strong family-based anchors I would truly be one lost soul and would have never met my father and have the opportunity to now make as many happy memories with our newfound loving family.

Welcome to the first day of forever.

I’ve got a really interesting story that brewed from telling my maternal grandma about my results (if you’re curious, I posted them about a week ago)! 

In short, I’m Australian and live in Australia; but I was born in New Zealand, she lives in New Zealand, and my nonno came to Australia on a boat in the 1950s from Italy with my aunties and uncles. My dad was the only one in his family born in Australia, so our heritage isn’t rooted here at all.

I wanted to see if she could guess the regions without me telling her. Gave her a call and she nailed the first 5 regions of Ireland in order. Incredible! She also nailed the first 3 of the English side from my grandfather.

Here’s where it gets interesting though; I never knew this, but many generations ago, one of my ancestors brother was convicted and sentenced to life in Australia for stealing a cow. Funny thing is, as the story goes, he didn’t actually steal a cow; a family who lived close had a baby they couldn’t feed, and he took pity on them, and lent them a cow for milk. After a while though, they refused to return the cow. Great uncle decided he’d get it back himself, and sure enough, the police didn’t take his side. He got sent off to Australia, and on the boat ride over, his wife and child got sick and died. He tried to start a new family in Australia, but never got his conviction overturned.

Apparently my grandfather was told this story when he was a child, so this isn’t something we just found on the internet. Every detail grandma gave me lined up with what I found online, and she can barely use the internet, so she didn’t plagiarise it. Did he actually steal the cow and the story about lending it is a cover up? Who knows!

It’s so interesting to me that our family has that link to Australia, over 100 years before my nonno moved here, on the complete other side of the family. It makes me wonder if it could have contributed to that side of my family moving to New Zealand in the late 1800s.",23andme,"['really', 'interesting', 'story', 'brewed', 'telling', 'maternal', 'grandma', 'result', 'curious', 'posted', 'week', 'short', 'australian', 'live', 'australia', 'born', 'zealand', 'life', 'zealand', 'nonno', 'came', 'australia', 'boat', '1950s', 'italy', 'aunty', 'uncle', 'family', 'born', 'australia', 'heritage', 'rooted', 'wanted', 'could', 'guess', 'region', 'without', 'telling', 'gave', 'call', 'nailed', 'first', 'region', 'ireland', 'order', 'incredible', 'also', 'nailed', 'first', 'english', 'side', 'grandfather', 'interesting', 'though', 'never', 'knew', 'many', 'generation', 'ancestor', 'brother', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'life', 'australia', 'stealing', 'funny', 'thing', 'story', 'actually', 'steal', 'family', 'lived', 'close', 'baby', 'feed', 'took', 'pity', 'lent', 'milk', 'though', 'refused', 'return', 'great', 'uncle', 'decided', 'back', 'sure', 'enough', 'police', 'take', 'side', 'sent', 'australia', 'boat', 'ride', 'wife', 'child', 'sick', 'died', 'tried', 'start', 'family', 'australia', 'never', 'conviction', 'overturned', 'apparently', 'grandfather', 'told', 'story', 'child', 'something', 'found', 'internet', 'every', 'detail', 'grandma', 'gave', 'lined', 'found', 'online', 'barely', 'internet', 'plagiarise', 'actually', 'steal', 'story', 'lending', 'cover', 'know', 'interesting', 'family', 'link', 'australia', 'year', 'nonno', 'moved', 'complete', 'side', 'family', 'make', 'wonder', 'could', 'contributed', 'side', 'family', 'moving', 'zealand', 'late', '1800s']","['found', 'great', 'uncle', 'mine', 'year', 'convict', 'sent', 'australia', 'telling', 'grandmother', 'result']","['really', 'interesting', 'story', 'brewed', 'telling', 'maternal_grandma', 'result', 'curious', 'posted', 'week', 'short', 'australian', 'live_australia', 'born', 'zealand', 'life', 'zealand', 'nonno', 'came', 'australia', 'boat', '1950s', 'italy', 'aunty_uncle', 'family', 'born', 'australia', 'heritage', 'rooted', 'wanted', 'could', 'guess', 'region', 'without_telling', 'gave', 'call', 'nailed', 'first', 'region', 'ireland', 'order', 'incredible', 'also', 'nailed', 'first', 'english', 'side', 'grandfather', 'interesting', 'though', 'never_knew', 'many', 'generation', 'ancestor', 'brother', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'life', 'australia', 'stealing', 'funny_thing', 'story', 'actually', 'steal', 'family', 'lived', 'close', 'baby', 'feed', 'took', 'pity', 'lent', 'milk', 'though', 'refused', 'return', 'great_uncle', 'decided', 'back', 'sure', 'enough', 'police', 'take', 'side', 'sent', 'australia', 'boat_ride', 'wife', 'child', 'sick', 'died', 'tried', 'start', 'family', 'australia', 'never', 'conviction', 'overturned', 'apparently', 'grandfather', 'told', 'story', 'child', 'something', 'found', 'internet', 'every', 'detail', 'grandma', 'gave', 'lined', 'found', 'online', 'barely', 'internet', 'plagiarise', 'actually', 'steal', 'story', 'lending', 'cover', 'know', 'interesting', 'family', 'link', 'australia', 'year', 'nonno', 'moved', 'complete', 'side', 'family', 'make_wonder', 'could', 'contributed', 'side', 'family', 'moving', 'zealand', 'late_1800s']","['found', 'great_uncle', 'mine', 'year', 'convict', 'sent', 'australia', 'telling', 'grandmother', 'result']"

However, unlike the social norms of the time, when their marriage was off to a rocky start they got divorced within two years. This was a big deal back then, especially since both were Catholic. 

During their brief marriage they had one child, a boy. After the divorce the mother left Rhode Island and moved back with family in the Midwest, the guess was Ohio. The man never saw his son for the rest of his life as they were completely out of touch. The boy would grow up with no memory of his father.

Fast forward to the 1970’s. A couple of high schoolers from a town in Rhode Island started dating. She was half Italian, the young man was one quarter Italian. He was one year ahead of her in school and graduated before her. The young man had aspirations of making his way to the silver screen, so he set out to pursue this dream by moving to the opposite coast of the country and settled in Los Angeles, California. 

Torn by the move, the young woman decided to drop out of high school, with the intent to obtain her G.E.D. At some later point, and followed the young man across the country. 

Within their first year out there, she became pregnant. It was a girl who she planned to name Cassandra. He was unhappy and had zero interest in becoming a father at only 19 years old. Ultimately she lost the baby, whether it was an abortion or miscarriage has been up for debate.

With the stress of a child on the way dissipating, the two tried to stay together. Leas than a year after the loss of the baby the two split up.

The woman, only 19 at this point, ended up seeing another man. He was 31 at the time, twelve years her senior. He was college educated and had a good job with a oil company as an accountant. He was full blooded Italian and by a strike of fate was also from Rhode Island. However he did not know any of his family from the little state as his mother took him to the Midwest as an infant.

Shortly into this torrid affair the young woman learned she was pregnant. She went to see a doctor and after assessment the doctor gave her a rough date of conception. The day was squarely in the time she was with the young man she followed to Hollywood. She ended things with the accountant and tried to work things out with the young man.

It didn’t last. He knew he didn’t want to be a father. The day before she went in labor, they fought and she clung to his legs as he was walking out. She went to the hospital the next day and gave birth shortly after midnight. She left the space for the father’s name blank.

Distraught and alone over three thousand miles from home and any family she had, the young woman was debating giving up the baby boy for adoption, an option her mother initially supported. Her mother flew across the country to give her daughter support. Upon seeing the baby, she could not let her grandson be adopted. She convinced her daughter to keep the baby and offered to support her back home in Rhode Island.

Upon returning to Rhode Island, the young woman reached out to the mother of the man she was led to believe was the father. This woman agreed to meet the baby and upon seeing him decided he was her grandson as he looked similar to her son… same color eyes, hair, similar complexion. Despite her son not wanting anything to do with the baby, she decided she wanted to be a part of the baby’s life. She and her second husband helped raise the boy as if he were their own grandson. 

When the boy was a toddler, the young woman met a man and ultimately married and had a daughter with him. As part of the new family, the man went through the legal system to adopt the boy. There was now a man’s name on the formerly blank birth certificate. For all intents and purposes, it seemed this man was going to raise this boy as his own. 

Unfortunately the man did not treat the boy as his own. He physically and verbally abused him almost daily for years. His daughter from his first marriage would sexually abuse the boy when she was twelve and he was six. It was not an ideal childhood in the least. 

Around the age of seven, the boy became curious… why did he have three grandmothers? Everyone else he knew, including his sister, had two. After asking his mother about this oddity, she decided to give him the basic details of his true heritage. As far as the boy was concerned, the man who adopted him was his father and an extra grandmother just meant more Christmas gifts.

When the boy was eight, his mother separated and ultimately divorced the man who adopted him. 

Four years later, at the age of twelve, the young boy was given the opportunity to meet who was believed to be his biological father. He took the opportunity. This guy couldn’t be any worse than the guy who adopted him, right?

The two didn’t really mesh well together. They looked similar enough to be thought of as father and son. They’d meet every now and again over the teenage years, but nothing consistent as the man still lived in California. 

At the age of thirteen, the adoptive father essentially cut off all ties with the boy. The teenager had mixed emotions… on one hand he was fatherless, yet on the other one was abusive and the other was absent. He got over it. 

The boy with two dads is obviously me. I went on to having three children of my own, the first coming at twenty years. A bit on the young side and if I did it again I would wait until late twenties or older. I haven’t been the perfect parent, but I damn sure wasn’t going to abuse my children. 

I did see both men one more time each after my late teens. Both times was at the funeral services of my grandmothers. It was mildly awkward, but I was well over it by this time. 

Years passed. DNA testing became a thing, AncestryDNA and 23andMe being the two most prominent. I decided to do both because why not? 

I did AncestryDNA first, which has differed slightly over the ensuing years as they make updates. As it stands, AncestryDNA has me at 67% Italian, with Greek, French, and the Balkans making up 7% and likely linked to the Italian ancestry. My maternal grandfather was from the UK, so I’ve got 26% coming from England, Ireland, and Scotland. 

23andMe was a bit different in their breakdown. Their site has me 72% Italian and also notes a few percent to France and Germany. So I measure between 2/3 and 3/4 Italian. A few family members, like my aunt and a couple cousins, showed up as matches. Literally zero alarm bells went off. 

Why should alarm bells have gone off? Because my mother was roughly half Italian and who I thought was my biological father was only one quarter Italian. So I should have been roughly one third Italian. This completely went over my head and I didn’t give it a second thought. 

A year or so went by. I’d check occasionally to see if any matches came up. A woman popped up as a first cousin, so I googled her. She was over twenty years older than I. My aunt as the oldest among aunts and uncles would have been five or six when this woman was born. This was impossible. There’s no way someone that much older than I could be a first cousin.

I took a screenshot and sent it to my mom. She loves fooling around with ancestry and such. Then I went about my life and again did not give it a second thought. 

It was a couple days before my 39th birthday. My mother texts me and says she needs to see me tomorrow. I replied that she’ll see me on my birthday a couple days from then, but she was insistent that it was urgent, but she wouldn’t let me know what it was about.

I was anxious, which isn’t the norm for me. My mother has a lot of health issues and cancer and heart issues run on that side of the family. I didn’t know what to expect.

The next day she arrives and she’s crying. My heart dropped. This was going to be something awful. 

It wasn’t.

She had researched the woman and came across her Facebook page. When scrolling through her friends list, a certain Italian surname came up often. It was the same name as the guy she dated briefly after splitting up with who I thought, as did she, was my biological dad. Turns out the doctor’s estimate on my conception date was way off. 

My mother reached out to the lady and messaged back and forth. The woman detailed how the family had a “secret” about her having an older brother from her father having a previous marriage. It was kept quiet for years until her father died and she got more details.

The mother took the boy out to the Midwest and the family never heard from him again, as I detailed at the beginning. She had hoped that she could find her half brother through the DNA testing. I was the clue she was desperately searching for and my mother was a possible bridge to the discovery. The woman who was classified as a first cousin was actually my half aunt, which would be in the same range as far as a match. 

Now my reaction to this was absolute ambivalence. I honestly don’t think I could have possibly cared less. The only things that piqued my interest was whether I had half siblings and what medical history might be helpful. My mother was so broken about it because she was there and knows about the abuse I endured and the lack of a real father figure. She apologized profusely… she believed life would’ve been so much different if that man had been my father.

As a manner of philosophy, I don’t dwell on the past too much. I view the past as a learning tool and little else. You know, spilled milk and such.

After reassuring my mother and chilling her out, she asked if she wanted me to contact him. I was honest and said I couldn’t possibly care less either way. I was almost 40, I’d been a father myself for nearly two decades, and I really didn’t see the point. The guy is in his seventies, I doubt we were going to meet up and have a catch. 

Well my mother is the type who is obsessed with the past. She found him on Facebook and decided to message him… she used the finesse of a medieval mace. He accepted her friend request and kept her there, but he blocked her on messenger. 

He unblocked her at some point and she sent a message saying there were people back in Rhode Island that were disappointed he chose not to have contact and left it at that. His half sister was very upset he wouldn’t respond, she had been looking for him for years and was so hopeful when I was the clue that solved her mystery. 

This was a couple years ago. I honestly don’t think about it at all unless I’m looking at this sub. I check both websites wondering if I’ll ever get a hit on a half sibling, but otherwise I am completely at peace with my life. It hasn’t been a perfect life and maybe it would have been better had he been involved to some degree, but hypotheticals don’t keep me up at night.

The rest of me is English.

I've gone back all the way to my Great Great Great Grandparents on both my parents sides and found everyone on [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com). There is a clear paper trail.

Obviously there is no record of one night stands, or who got more than a pint of milk from Heinz the milkman or a bit frisky with Pierre the Postman...

So just wondering if it's worth going back further or if it's likely someone was a bit naughty in the past.

As a side note doing this has led me to find out that out of 8 generations and like 300 people, my son was the only child ever in my side of the family to be conceived outside of wedlock.

Ya know the old trope about ""cheating on your spouse with the milk man""?

My biological grandpa- He was the milk man.  Yes, the guy who delivered fresh milk to peoples homes until the job faded away in I think the 60s?  Yep.  My mom was born in 1954, and my grandma cheated on her hubby with the milk man.

Despite my family drama (long story, different day)

Growing up my mom always suspected my grandpa-was no her biological father.  (I always called him my grandpa growing up anyway) and she loves him like a dad.

I loved him like a grandpa.  The truth about him being my mom's biological father she took to her grave in 1996.  My grandpa always assumed all 5 of his kids were his.  My mom is the youngest of the 5.  He died in 1991, and it would have killed him to know the truth.

What I learned changes nothing.  He was always kind, and gentle and loving.  Though we are not related by blood, he will always be my grandpa.

Only two certainly matched, three were close, and three opposite to my own estimates. I mean I think I know myself whether I flush after drinking alcohol, whether I move during sleep (through much of my adult life I have had 'restless leg') and whether I can digest milk.

I am just surprised that such a small amount of NA DNA would contribute to the phenotypic traits that appear to be NA.  The rest of his DNA is british, German, Swedish. With most being british.

I know who my relatives are dating back to the late 1600s.  My grandfather lived in Vienna during the The Third Reich, my grandmother was from Ulm, Germany.  Both sides of the family are blond haired, blue-eyed, with very fair skin.  I sent my sample to 23 ;Me and [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) and two other labs just to cross-check results.  23 ;Me said I was 99.3% German/Austrian and 0.7% from Somalia! Somalia!  They estimated that my family tree had Somali DNA enter it around 1750.  Both sides of the family were farmers...no one ever traveled to Africa, or Africa below the Sahara Desert.   I know who my great great great grandparents were.  Most people don't but my maternal grandfather was in the SS and had his family history documented back to 1720.  My paternal grandparents were Tyrolers who never left the Alps..except my paternal grandfather served as an ""oberst"" or colonel in the Waffen SS.  My maternal grandmother never traveled out of Europe.  There is just no way I have Somali DNA.  [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) refutes 23 ;Me.  The other two (Navigenics and Veritas) said I was 100% Germanic.

I know someone who is Northern Italian (Milan) who was told she had Sudanese DNA 0.2%. She's as white as milk.

23andMe and Wegene seem to disagree on my genetic makeup, I think the truth probably lies somewhere between the two. I do have manchu ancestry, so that's probably where 23andMe is getting the Mongolian from, and my family is from the border of China and Korea. 

As for traits, 23andMe got most of it right, but it thought I have detached earlobes (I don't), like salty food (I prefer sweet things), freckles (I don't), longer big toe (they are actually equal), and is lactose intolerant (I don't have any reaction to milk afaik).

""Middle Eastern"" strikes me as a broad category though.  Does this mean the Levant, Persia, Arabia, etc?  There are many different ethnic groups that are Middle Eastern.  

I'd like to submit my raw data to more places to get a further breakdown if possible.  What do you all recommend?  

Any of you do the Health as well?  My results on this were good so I am happy.
