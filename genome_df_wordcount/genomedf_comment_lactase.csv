If Irish people say Irish-Americans are not Irish. They are NOT Irish. And it's a bit distasteful to demand otherwise.

You have to realize how silly this sounds. As I have said repeatedly, I am not a European from Europe. I don't have citizenship and I couldn't tell you what cartoons you watched as a child or what specific cultural traditions feel or look like. I am part of the European diaspora. The history of Europe before my ancestors fled is shared with you and every other European. The history afterwards is part of the European diaspora.

For example, the bubonic plague is relevant to my genome, Astrid Lindgren books are not. I am Roman Catholic on all sides of my family, and wouldn't have been born if that wasn't the case. My ancestors were pagans just like yours before Christianity in Europe. I LITERALLY look European and all my genetics are equipped to deal with the environment of Europe over thousands of years. It's pretty cool to have spent only a week of my life in Europe, yet I can drink milk from a cows tit (lactase persistence) and could produce a blue eyed and fair haired child. Do you realize how intimate of a relationship that is? Clearly by the definition of ethnicity you provided I am European in many ways. You don't get to be the bouncer at the club who lets me in and I know and don't care that I don't fit your criteria for being European.",h9206sd,t1_h90dj6r,/r/AncestryDNA/comments/p40rep/which_percentage_of_dna_makes_you_part_of_that/h9206sd/,1,AncestryDNA,"['something', 'offensive', 'acting', 'like', 'part', 'group', 'people', 'part', 'think', 'respected', 'irish', 'people', 'irish-americans', 'irish', 'irish', 'distasteful', 'demand', 'otherwise', 'realize', 'silly', 'sound', 'said', 'repeatedly', 'european', 'europe', 'citizenship', 'could', 'tell', 'cartoon', 'watched', 'child', 'specific', 'cultural', 'tradition', 'feel', 'look', 'like', 'part', 'european', 'diaspora', 'history', 'europe', 'ancestor', 'fled', 'shared', 'every', 'european', 'history', 'afterwards', 'part', 'european', 'diaspora', 'example', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'relevant', 'genome', 'astrid', 'lindgren', 'book', 'roman', 'catholic', 'side', 'family', 'would', 'born', 'case', 'ancestor', 'pagan', 'like', 'christianity', 'europe', 'literally', 'look', 'european', 'genetics', 'equipped', 'deal', 'environment', 'europe', 'thousand', 'year', 'pretty', 'cool', 'spent', 'week', 'life', 'europe', 'drink', 'milk', 'lactase', 'persistence', 'could', 'produce', 'blue', 'eyed', 'fair', 'haired', 'child', 'realize', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'clearly', 'definition', 'ethnicity', 'provided', 'european', 'many', 'bouncer', 'club', 'know', 'care', 'criterion', 'european']","['something', 'offensive', 'acting_like', 'part', 'group', 'people', 'part', 'think', 'respected', 'irish', 'people', 'irish-americans', 'irish', 'irish', 'distasteful', 'demand', 'otherwise', 'realize', 'silly', 'sound', 'said', 'repeatedly', 'european', 'europe', 'citizenship', 'could', 'tell', 'cartoon', 'watched', 'child', 'specific', 'cultural_tradition', 'feel', 'look_like', 'part', 'european', 'diaspora', 'history', 'europe', 'ancestor', 'fled', 'shared', 'every', 'european', 'history', 'afterwards', 'part', 'european', 'diaspora', 'example', 'bubonic_plague', 'relevant', 'genome', 'astrid', 'lindgren', 'book', 'roman_catholic', 'side', 'family', 'would', 'born', 'case', 'ancestor', 'pagan', 'like', 'christianity', 'europe', 'literally', 'look', 'european', 'genetics', 'equipped', 'deal', 'environment', 'europe', 'thousand_year', 'pretty_cool', 'spent_week', 'life', 'europe', 'drink_milk', 'lactase_persistence', 'could', 'produce', 'blue_eyed', 'fair_haired', 'child', 'realize', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'clearly', 'definition', 'ethnicity', 'provided', 'european', 'many', 'bouncer', 'club', 'know', 'care', 'criterion', 'european']"

207133,Darth_Bfheidir,2020-09-13 00:47:09,"&gt; So where does the ‘Dark Irish’ actually originate from? 

Considering that skin, eye and hair colour are what are called ***complex traits*** it is possible that both your parents have some dark skin genes and mostly light skin genes, and thus are light skinned. However it is possible that YOU inherited all of your parents dark skin genes and few of their light skin genes, skewing your complexion to a dark colour.

  

The best example of this I can think of is red hair; two people who have dark hair can have red haired children, because though they are both carriers they do not express the trait, but they pass it on to children who do express the trait much like a recessive trait can appear in the child of a person who doesn't express that trait.

  

So that deals with you, as for the origin of the dark complexion traits I would say firstly that this is something I've never really researched and don't feel like I am an authority on the subject. That said while Irish people are quite homogenous compared to other populations, regional differences did arise that can be traced back, there was a really good study done on Irish and British regional genetics, I think it was by the Uni of Oxford in collaboration with UCD or TCD or something. Some of these communities may just have had and passed on more dark-complexion genes.

  

Another cooler (but probably less likely) is that we inherited these traits from those people who were in Ireland before the Gaels arrived. I heard a particular story, I think it was in belfast where three prehistoric Irish skeletons were discovered; two males and one female. The males were genotyped and they had fair skin and also the lactase persistence gene that is widespread in the Irish population; they were proto-irish. However the female skeleton was found to have been dark haired and dark skinned, and seemed to have some connection to the middle east iirc. If these pre-gaelic Irish people were not wiped out but interbred with the more numerous gaels then their genetic heritage would still exist today, indistinguishable from those that came after them.

  

The last bit is some fluff theory-crafting but its still a fun possibility, however wild and unlikely it is.",g50dtab,t1_g508oo1,/r/AncestryDNA/comments/irlx8d/got_my_results_for_not_being_irish_i_was_not/g50dtab/,3,AncestryDNA,"['dark', 'irish', 'actually', 'originate', 'considering', 'skin', 'hair', 'colour', 'called', 'complex', 'trait', 'possible', 'parent', 'dark', 'skin', 'gene', 'mostly', 'light', 'skin', 'gene', 'thus', 'light', 'skinned', 'however', 'possible', 'inherited', 'parent', 'dark', 'skin', 'gene', 'light', 'skin', 'gene', 'skewing', 'complexion', 'dark', 'colour', 'best', 'example', 'think', 'hair', 'people', 'dark', 'hair', 'haired', 'child', 'though', 'carrier', 'express', 'trait', 'child', 'express', 'trait', 'much', 'like', 'recessive', 'trait', 'appear', 'child', 'person', 'express', 'trait', 'deal', 'origin', 'dark', 'complexion', 'trait', 'would', 'firstly', 'something', 'never', 'really', 'researched', 'feel', 'like', 'authority', 'subject', 'said', 'irish', 'people', 'quite', 'homogenous', 'compared', 'population', 'regional', 'difference', 'arise', 'traced', 'back', 'really', 'good', 'study', 'done', 'irish', 'british', 'regional', 'genetics', 'think', 'oxford', 'collaboration', 'something', 'community', 'passed', 'dark-complexion', 'gene', 'another', 'cooler', 'probably', 'likely', 'inherited', 'trait', 'people', 'ireland', 'gael', 'arrived', 'heard', 'particular', 'story', 'think', 'belfast', 'three', 'prehistoric', 'irish', 'skeleton', 'discovered', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'genotyped', 'fair', 'skin', 'also', 'lactase', 'persistence', 'gene', 'widespread', 'irish', 'population', 'proto-irish', 'however', 'female', 'skeleton', 'found', 'dark', 'haired', 'dark', 'skinned', 'seemed', 'connection', 'middle', 'east', 'iirc', 'pre-gaelic', 'irish', 'people', 'wiped', 'interbred', 'numerous', 'gael', 'genetic', 'heritage', 'would', 'still', 'exist', 'today', 'indistinguishable', 'came', 'last', 'fluff', 'theory-crafting', 'still', 'possibility', 'however', 'wild', 'unlikely']","['dark', 'irish', 'actually', 'originate', 'considering', 'skin_hair_colour', 'called', 'complex_trait', 'possible', 'parent', 'dark_skin', 'gene', 'mostly', 'light_skin', 'gene', 'thus', 'light_skinned', 'however', 'possible', 'inherited', 'parent', 'dark_skin', 'gene', 'light_skin', 'gene', 'skewing', 'complexion_dark', 'colour', 'best', 'example', 'think', 'hair', 'people', 'dark_hair', 'haired', 'child', 'though', 'carrier', 'express_trait', 'child', 'express_trait', 'much', 'like', 'recessive_trait', 'appear', 'child', 'person', 'express_trait', 'deal', 'origin', 'dark_complexion', 'trait', 'would', 'firstly', 'something', 'never', 'really', 'researched', 'feel_like', 'authority', 'subject', 'said', 'irish', 'people', 'quite', 'homogenous', 'compared', 'population', 'regional_difference', 'arise', 'traced_back', 'really', 'good', 'study_done', 'irish', 'british', 'regional', 'genetics', 'think', 'oxford', 'collaboration', 'something', 'community', 'passed', 'dark-complexion', 'gene', 'another', 'cooler', 'probably', 'likely', 'inherited', 'trait', 'people', 'ireland', 'gael', 'arrived', 'heard', 'particular', 'story', 'think', 'belfast', 'three', 'prehistoric', 'irish', 'skeleton', 'discovered', 'male_female_male', 'genotyped', 'fair_skin', 'also', 'lactase_persistence', 'gene', 'widespread', 'irish', 'population', 'proto-irish', 'however', 'female', 'skeleton_found', 'dark_haired', 'dark_skinned', 'seemed', 'connection', 'middle_east', 'iirc', 'pre-gaelic', 'irish', 'people', 'wiped', 'interbred', 'numerous', 'gael', 'genetic', 'heritage', 'would', 'still', 'exist', 'today', 'indistinguishable', 'came', 'last', 'fluff', 'theory-crafting', 'still', 'possibility', 'however', 'wild', 'unlikely']"

Also look at E-V32 on yfull tree lmfao  
Why are you comparing us to recent mixes? We got mixed much before them! Also that study does have some flaws (assuming the Ethio-Somali component is predominantly Eurasian when it's essentially a 50/50 split between Dzudzuana and indigenous East African) so here's a better one  


https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62645-0  
""Our data reveal a **remarkably homogeneous** Somali population with roots from **ancient mixtures** of populations from Africa and the Middle East. **We observed that a vast majority of our study individuals carried similar proportions of genes from those ancient populations**, which possibly can be explained by the fact that ethnic Somalis have a strong genetic unification by **endogamy**""  


As for West Africans not getting those results,  its because people have West African data? I don't think you understand how DNA tests work... they default to the best samples. It would look something like this If I removed West African.   
[https://i.imgur.com/RvSpMD5.png](https://i.imgur.com/RvSpMD5.png)  


&gt;You are fully aware of what is meant by the term ""Arab"" in modern vernacular. Don't hide behind semantics to obfuscate.

It's your problem if you don't use the correct words LOL, either way we didn't mix with Arabians either (only 5% Yemeni, that's nothing), mixing with Arabians is more of an Ethiopian thing. 

  

&gt;I'm sure the basal genetics of the Horn was ""codified"" thousands of years ago that does not mean there has not been more contemporary intermixing

There has been, its just minor for Somalis, because of how endogamous we are. 

  

&gt;The consolidation of the Levantine, Southwest Asian and various European results into ""European Jewish"" is a choice on the part of testing companies

Clearly, you do not understand how DNA tests work. It was very easy to add Ashkenazi samples to their database due to how homogenous Ashkenazi Jews are. They're essentially all related to eachother. It wasn't a choice the way you put it, it was just a matter of adding samples to a database 🤦🏾

  

&gt;They were getting Horner and Middle Eastern. The basal component was acknowledged. But since they did not like seeing the Middle East they whined and they did for you what they do for Jewish people. Isolate the relatively contemporary middle east genes present in Somalis and relabel them as Somali.

Now I can see 2 things. One, you don't understand how DNA tests work, and two, you don't know anything about our genetic history. Most of our East African blood is from Sudan! If we just scored groups in the Horn of Africa when it comes to our Subsaharan Ancestry, it's because the Horn of Africa is very diverse and has tons of Nilotic, Omotic, Nilo-Hamitic peoples, etc, an they're more pure than the ones left in Sudan. It even has pure Arabians (Rashaida). And again, the way it was done isn't at all how you're explaining it. All it takes is to add samples, and 23andme literally states in their websites that they want to use samples from populations who were the same way b4 travel became common. Somali fits that definition so they took Somali samples, and we were very homogenous so it helped them. Not hard at all! If they didn't have West African samples, you would've had a mixed result as well 😂 I already showed you how this is not a Horner issue only, by using Sami and West African samples. The difference is, Europe and West Africa have tons of samples.   


&gt;Having a distance of 40's isn't particularly close. Where are you getting those estimated from anyway?

Not sure where you got those distances from. It was at most 20-22%, which is reasonable. I'm getting those estimates from [https://g25.ancestralwhispers.org/](https://g25.ancestralwhispers.org/)  


I showed you the studies which show we are homogenous and that show how long ago our Eurasian component separated from the others. Now, can you please stop spreading misinformation about us somehow being mixed with Arabs or whatever? And stop lying about the way that 23andme updates their database. The way they do it is essentially the same for anyone, there was no special process involved for us. The vast majority of Africans are ""mixed race"", here's a study that proves the simulations i'm showing you about West Africans.

&gt;We carried out admixture graph modeling of the allele frequency correlations and found two parsimonious models that fit the data. The first posited that present-day western Africans harbor ancestry from a basal African lineage that contributed more to the Mende than it did to the Yoruba, with the other source of western African ancestry being related to eastern Africans and non-Africans (Fig. 3D; Fig. S4; Fig. S5; Table S6). The second model posited that long-range and long-standing gene-flow has connected southern and eastern Africa to some groups in western Africa (e.g. the ancestors of the Yoruba) to a greater extent than to other groups in western Africa (e.g. the ancestors of the Mende) (Fig. 3E) (Pleurdeau et al., 2012). The possible basal western African population lineage would represent the earliest known divergence of a modern human lineage that contributed a major proportion of ancestry to present-day humans. Such a lineage must have separated before the divergence of San ancestors, which is estimated to have begun on the order of 200 to 300 thousand years ago (Scally and Durbin, 2012). Such a model of basal western African ancestry might support the hypothesis that there has been ancient structure in the ancestry of present-day Africans, using a line of evidence independent from previous findings based on long haplotypes with deep divergences from other human haplotypes (Hammer et al., 2011; Lachance et al., 2012; Plagnol and Wall, 2006). One scenario consistent with this result could involve ancestry related to eastern Africans (and the out-of-Africa population) expanding into western Africa and mixing there with more basal lineages. Our genetic data do not support the theory that this putative basal lineage diverged prior to the ancestors of Neandertals, since the African populations we analyze here are approximately symmetrically related to Neandertals (Mallick et al., 2016; Prufer et al., 2014).",iiwlnpf,t1_iiv45fy,/r/23andme/comments/wdr4yu/somali_dna_results/iiwlnpf/,1,23andme,"['said', 'natufian-like',

Yeah neolithic farmers were mostly brown-eyed, they largely displaced the native blue-eyed hunter gatherers of Britain.  Later during the bronce age they were in turn displaced by people of the bell beaker culture.

According to [this](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/07/052084.full.pdf) paper, blue eyes have been strongly selected for in Britain for the last 2,000 years.

321271,T_r_a_d_e__K_i_n_g_,2021-06-20 08:24:33,"The West Eurasian ancestry in Horners is from anywhere between 23,000 years ago and 4,000 years ago. That is suggested in this quote from a DNA study (the West Eurasian DNA component in the study is called ""Ethio-Somali):

""The Ethio-Somali ancestry is found in all admixed HOA ethnic groups, shows little inter-individual variance within these ethnic groups, is estimated to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries by at least 23 ka, and does not carry the unique Arabian lactase persistence allele that arose about 4 ka."" 

And they further imply: 

""In combination, these data suggest that the Ethio-Somali ancestors admixed with African-origin HOA ancestors sometime after 23 ka, but before the Middle Eastern admixture during the last few thousand years."" 

And from haplogroups in the region, they show to be between the same referenced 23k-4k year time frame in possibly multiple waves of non-African DNA: 

""Archaeological data indicate trade between the HOA and Arabia by at least 8 ka [30], [31] and genetic analyses of mitochondrial and Y chromosome data suggest much earlier migrations into the HOA. Mitochondrial data are suggestive of as many as three waves of prehistoric non-African migration into the HOA. First, HOA populations carry several unique M1 lineages of the otherwise South and East Asian mitochondrial haplogroup M [13], [32]–[34]. Many of these HOA M1 lineages have deep roots, diverging from M1 representatives elsewhere 20–30 ka [34]–[36]. Second, representatives of N1a and N2a in the HOA diverged from their most closely related haplotypes in the Middle East and the Caucasus 15–20 ka [37]. Third, in the Eurasian mitochondrial HV1 and R0a lineages there are several sub-haplogroups (HV1a3, HV1b1, R0a2b, R0a2g) that are found in both the HOA and the Arabian Peninsula. Within these shared sub-haplogroup lineages, the HOA and Arabian haplotypes are distinct, suggesting that the migration that brought these lineages into the HOA happened soon after the sub-haplogroups began to diversify at 6–10 ka [38], [39].

Y chromosome data are also suggestive of at least two episodes of non-African migration into the HOA prior to 3 ka. First, HOA populations carry E-M78 Y chromosomes at high frequencies [40], [41]. E-M78 originated in northeastern Africa around 19 ka with a descendant lineage (E-V32) unique to the HOA that arrived by at least 6 ka [41]. Because northern African populations in this timeframe are inferred to have substantial non-African ancestry [42], [43], the expansion south of E-M78 could have introduced non-African ancestry into the HOA prior to 6 ka. Second, some HOA populations carry moderate to high frequencies of T-M70 (previously K2-M70) Y chromosomes [44]–[46]. The T haplogroup originated in the area of the Levant approximately 21 ka and the T-M70 sub-haplogroup was present in northeast Africa by at least 14 ka, possibly arriving in the HOA as early as 5 ka [44], [45], [47].""

And lastly, I have no agenda here. I'm merely quoting what is printed in peer-reviewed scientific DNA studies, which all of them say Horners are Half/half mixed populations. I called them mixed race yes because I subscribe to biological race. You can choose not to use the term race, that's on you. But many people still use the term race for multigenerational genetic groups of the same ancestral origin despite if political correctness and woke leftism is now controlling the narrative in academia today. So in that context, Somalis and other Horners are indeed mixed race. 40%-50% West Eurasian (formerly known as caucasoid).",h2erb8s,t1_h1wl1ws,/r/23andme/comments/nz1qiy/ive_always_thought_i_was_full_somali_since_both/h2erb8s/,1,23andme,"['west', 'eurasian', 'ancestry', 'horners', 'anywhere', '23,000', 'year',

 The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia. The Ethio-Somali ancestry is found in all admixed HOA ethnic groups, shows little inter-individual variance within these ethnic groups, is estimated to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries by at least 23 ka, and does not carry the unique Arabian lactase persistence allele that arose about 4 ka. Taking into account published mitochondrial, Y chromosome, paleoclimate, and archaeological data, we find that the time of the Ethio-Somali back-to-Africa migration is most likely pre-agricultural.

Numerous genetic studies over the last decades have identified substantial non-African ancestry in populations in this region. Because there is archaeological, historical, and linguistic evidence for contact with non-African populations beginning about 3,000 years ago, it has often been assumed that the non-African ancestry in HOA populations dates to this time. In this work, we find that the genetic composition of non-African ancestry in the HOA is distinct from the genetic composition of current populations in North Africa and the Middle East. With these data, we demonstrate that most non-African ancestry in the HOA cannot be the result of admixture within the last few thousand years, and that the majority of admixture probably occurred prior to the advent of agriculture.

 Genetic studies have identified substantial non-African admixture in the Horn of Africa (HOA). In the most recent genomic studies, this non-African ancestry has been attributed to admixture with Middle Eastern populations during the last few thousand years. However, mitochondrial and Y chromosome data are suggestive of earlier episodes of admixture. To investigate this further, we generated new genome-wide SNP data for a Yemeni population sample and merged these new data with published genome-wide genetic data from the HOA and a broad selection of surrounding populations. We used multidimensional scaling and ADMIXTURE methods in an exploratory data analysis to develop hypotheses on admixture and population structure in HOA populations. These analyses suggested that there might be distinct, differentiated African and non-African ancestries in the HOA. After partitioning the SNP data into African and non-African origin chromosome segments, we found support for a distinct African (Ethiopic) ancestry and a distinct non-African (Ethio-Somali) ancestry in HOA populations. The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population. The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia.

And dismissing a credible link to post all that with no context just to push your own opinions doesn't help here. Alot of what you say is covered in the same study that took in account most of the recent ancestry you reference and Ancient. Here's the full more detailed study. Your skimming over a large chunk of time and a good piece of solid information because you don't agree with it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/

These relatively recent dates are not consistent with our results showing a distinct, differentiated non-African ancestry in the HOA. To be sure, the greater shared gene identity between HOA populations and MENA populations with higher proportions of the Maghrebi IAC (Figure 4A) and the observed genetic-geographic correlation with Arabian populations (Figure 4B) are supportive of some relatively recent admixture. However, the high population differentiation found in the AMOVA and population tree analyses (Figure 5) suggests that admixture within the last few thousand years is a poor explanation for the majority of non-African ancestry in the HOA.

unique East African lactase persistence allele is found at its highest frequency in the Maasai [75] who have about 21% Ethio-Somali ancestry (Table S5). This lactase persistence allele is different from the alleles associated with lactase persistence in Europe [76], [77] or Arabia [78], [79], and likely arose during the last 7,000 years [75]. The Maasai do not have the Arabian lactase persistence allele, which is estimated to have originated about 4,000 years ago (95% CI: 250–27,575) and is present at high frequencies in Arabian populations (&gt;50%) [78], [79]. This Arabian allele is also almost absent in the Somali (1.6%) [79], which further supports our hypothesis that gene flow from Arabia within the last few thousand years cannot explain the non-African ancestry in HOA populations.

Because there is archaeological, historical, and linguistic evidence for contact with non-African populations beginning about 3,000 years ago, it has often been assumed that the non-African ancestry in HOA populations dates to this time. In this work, we find that the genetic composition of non-African ancestry in the HOA is distinct from the genetic composition of current populations in North Africa and the Middle East. With these data, we demonstrate that most non-African ancestry in the HOA cannot be the result of admixture within the last few thousand years, and that the majority of admixture probably occurred prior to the advent of agriculture. These results contribute to a growing body of work showing that prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations were much more dynamic than usually assumed.

Ethio-Somali IAC is broadly distributed across almost all ethnic groups in the HOA, consistent with an early entry into the region; that there is less inter-individual variance in Ethio-Somali IAC among individuals within ethnic groups than in Arabian or Eurasian IACs, suggesting that Ethio-Somali admixture predates the Arabian and Eurasian admixture; that the Ethio-Somali IAC is estimated to have diverged from all other non-African IACs by at least 23 ka; and that the Ethio-Somali IAC does not contain the unique Arabian lactase persistence allele that arose about 4 ka. In combination, these data suggest that the Ethio-Somali ancestors admixed with African-origin HOA ancestors sometime after 23 ka, but before the Middle Eastern admixture during the last few thousand years.

Contemporary HOA populations have occasionally been included in craniometric or dental studies of the biological affinities of ancient North Africans and Egyptians [93]–[95], but very little comparative analysis is available for the few prehistoric HOA skeletal collections [89], [96]. One possible indication of ancient Ethio-Somali admixture might be found in studies of Late Pleistocene Nubians (∼12 ka) from the Nile River Valley, who have been variously interpreted as sharing affinities with contemporaneous North African Iberomaurusians [97] and with sub-Saharan Africans [98]. Admixture of Ethio-Somali ancestors with African-origin populations in this region might explain these divergent interpretations of this Late Pleistocene Nubian population.

In the African-origins model, the original diversification of the Afro-Asiatic languages is pre-agricultural, with the source population living in the central Nile valley, the African Red Sea hills, or the HOA [108], [111]. In this model, later diversification and expansion within particular Afro-Asiatic language groups may be associated with agricultural expansions and transmissions, but the deep diversification of the group is pre-agricultural. We hypothesize that a population with substantial Ethio-Somali ancestry could be the proto-Afro-Asiatic speakers. A later migration of a subset of this population back to the Levant before 6 ka would account for a Levantine origin of the Semitic languages [18] and the relatively even distribution of around 7% Ethio-Somali ancestry in all sampled Levantine populations (Table S6). Later migration from Arabia into the HOA beginning around 3 ka would explain the origin of the Ethiosemitic languages at this time [18], the presence of greater Arabian and Eurasian ancestry in the Semitic speaking populations of the HOA (Table 2, S6), and ROLLOFF/ALDER estimates of admixture in HOA populations between 1–5 ka (

Everything you mentioned and assumed hadn't been accounted for is in the study. So how is it dated? Especially since no other study has reexamined and found flaws in it since its publication. Or atleast not that I'm aware of which is why I asked for a link earlier to keep me up to speed.

we found support for a distinct African (Ethiopic) ancestry and a distinct non-African (Ethio-Somali) ancestry in HOA populations. The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population. The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia. The Ethio-Somali ancestry is found in all admixed HOA ethnic groups, shows little inter-individual variance within these ethnic groups, is estimated to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries by at least 23 ka, and does not carry the unique Arabian lactase persistence allele that arose about 4 ka.

Quotes from your article:

  The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia. The Ethio-Somali ancestry is found in all admixed HOA ethnic groups, shows little inter-individual variance within these ethnic groups, is estimated to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries by at least 23 ka, and does not carry the unique Arabian lactase persistence allele that arose about 4 ka. Taking into account published mitochondrial, Y chromosome, paleoclimate, and archaeological data, we find that the time of the Ethio-Somali back-to-Africa migration is most likely pre-agricultural. 

  

 Populations in the Horn of Africa (HOA: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia) have substantial non-African ancestry [\[11\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Levine1)–[\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Non1). The most recent genomic studies estimate 30–50% non-African ancestry in the Cushitic and Semitic speaking populations of the HOA resulting primarily from admixture around 3 ka [\[16\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Pagani1), [\[17\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Pickrell1).  

  

 We find that most of the non-African ancestry in the HOA can be assigned to a distinct non-African origin Ethio-Somali ancestry component, which is found at its highest frequencies in Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations ([Table 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/table/pgen-1004393-t002/), [Figure 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/figure/pgen-1004393-g002/)). In addition to verifying that most HOA populations have substantial non-African ancestry, which is not controversial [\[11\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Levine1)–[\[14\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Ehret1), [\[16\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Pagani1), we argue that the non-African origin Ethio-Somali ancestry in the HOA is most likely pre-agricultural. In combination with the genomic evidence for a pre-agricultural back-to-Africa migration into North Africa [\[43\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Henn1), [\[61\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-SnchezQuinto1) and inference of pre-agricultural migrations in and out-of-Africa from mitochondrial and Y chromosome data

[\[32\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-QuintanaMurci1)–[\[37\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4055572/#pgen.1004393-Fernandes1),

Abstract
Genetic studies have identified substantial non-African admixture in the Horn of Africa (HOA). In the most recent genomic studies, this non-African ancestry has been attributed to admixture with Middle Eastern populations during the last few thousand years. However, mitochondrial and Y chromosome data are suggestive of earlier episodes of admixture. To investigate this further, we generated new genome-wide SNP data for a Yemeni population sample and merged these new data with published genome-wide genetic data from the HOA and a broad selection of surrounding populations. We used multidimensional scaling and ADMIXTURE methods in an exploratory data analysis to develop hypotheses on admixture and population structure in HOA populations. These analyses suggested that there might be distinct, differentiated African and non-African ancestries in the HOA. After partitioning the SNP data into African and non-African origin chromosome segments, we found support for a distinct African (Ethiopic) ancestry and a distinct non-African (Ethio-Somali) ancestry in HOA populations. The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population. The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia. The Ethio-Somali ancestry is found in all admixed HOA ethnic groups, shows little inter-individual variance within these ethnic groups, is estimated to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries by at least 23 ka, and does not carry the unique Arabian lactase persistence allele that arose about 4 ka. Taking into account published mitochondrial, Y chromosome, paleoclimate, and archaeological data, we find that the time of the Ethio-Somali back-to-Africa migration is most likely pre-agricultural.

Author Summary
The Horn of Africa (HOA) occupies a central place in our understanding of modern human origins. This region is the location of the earliest known modern human fossils, a possible source for the out-of-Africa migration, and one of the most genetically and linguistically diverse regions of the world. Numerous genetic studies over the last decades have identified substantial non-African ancestry in populations in this region. Because there is archaeological, historical, and linguistic evidence for contact with non-African populations beginning about 3,000 years ago, it has often been assumed that the non-African ancestry in HOA populations dates to this time. In this work, we find that the genetic composition of non-African ancestry in the HOA is distinct from the genetic composition of current populations in North Africa and the Middle East. With these data, we demonstrate that most non-African ancestry in the HOA cannot be the result of admixture within the last few thousand years, and that the majority of admixture probably occurred prior to the advent of agriculture. These results contribute to a growing body of work showing that prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations were much more dynamic than usually assumed.",gaahjhh,t1_ga6v70y,/r/23andme/comments/ji7ris/got_my_updated_results/gaahjhh/,1,23andme,"['west', 'eurasian', 'anicent', 'confined', 'meant', 'lived', 'outside', 'africa', 'time', 'keep',

711976,asher_irontooth,2019-06-19 21:48:42,"From what I've read, it seems like the high altitude adaptations in Tibetans and Andeans are completely independent. Humans have a physiological response to low oxygen environments that cause the density of hemoglobin in our blood to go up, which can put a lot of strain on the cardiovascular system long-term. Tibetans have variants, some of them appearing to be Denisovan in origin, that make the levels of hemoglobin naturally lower than average, but more efficient at transporting oxygen. Andeans have variants that affect the structure of their cardiovascular system that help combat the negative effects of their high hemoglobin levels. After the discovery of the Denisovan-like adaptive introgressed variants in Tibetans, some researchers analyzed the DNA of contemporary and ancient Andeans to see if there was anything similar, and didn't find anything archaic related to high altitude adaptation.

There are some archaic introgressed variants that do occur in higher frequency in indigenous American populations, though. The diabetes-risk variant I mentioned was first identified in indigenous Mexicans and has been found at higher frequency in them and other indigenous Hispanic populations relative to other populations worldwide, and appears to be Neanderthal in origin. And the cold adaptation variant is thought to be introgressed from an as yet unidentified Denisovan-like archaic hominin, and is present at 98% frequency in contemporary Greenlandic Inuit.

Adaptations can definitely occur independently though. Lactase persistence (lactose tolerance) is one example that has occurred independently in three human populations. But they're not identical mutations, they just serve the same purpose. The variants found in contemporary humans that are thought to be introgressed are similar enough to those found in archaic hominins that the explanation that they originated in archaic hominins and passed to us through interbreeding is by far the most probable.

755906,arxndo,2019-02-07 01:29:41,"If you really want to get into the technical details, you should try taking a look at [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4795055/) from 2015 analyzing the Fine-scale human genetic structure in Western France.

From what I gather in the abstract and discussion, the [lactase gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence#Gene-culture_coevolution_hypothesis) and the genes corresponding to the [HLA complex] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen) (ie. ""Celtic Curse"") are similar in both Irish and Breton populations, and are an important part of separating out Bretons from wother West Europeans in the statistical analysis ([PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)).

&gt;We found distinctive ancestries for Vendean
and Breton individuals and the latter were found to have genetic
proximities with Irish individuals. At a more subtle level, we also
identified very fine-scale population structure within the Pays de la
Loire Region.

The next step for me is figuring out the extent to which the scientists at 23andme use this paper, or any other recent paper like this, to fine tune its model. The algorithm that 23andme uses is described in its 2014 [white paper](https://permalinks.23andme.com/pdf/23-16_ancestry_composition.pdf). They describe the training data in the following way:

&gt;We trained the local classifier on more than 9700 individuals divided into K = 25 reference populations. We
denote N the number of training individuals. The reference populations are a combination of countries and
broader geographic regions. We required that a population contain at least 25 individuals.

The authors continue

&gt;We started by building a dataset of N∗ = 10699 unrelated individuals with known/self-reported ancestry.
Out of the 10699 individuals, 1793 came from publicly available...
The remaining 8906 were research-consented 23andMe members who reported via a survey on the
23andMe website that their four grandparents were born in the same country. The text of the questions
asked was “In which country was your (mother’s mother) born?”, for each of the four grandparents.

If all 23andme is doing is using support vector machines ([SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine)) to cluster our DNA into 25 different populations that are categorized by a survey, no wonder there are going to be problems with reporting Celtic/Breton heritage. I think it would be better for 23andme to remove Brittany from the ""French  ; German"" category and put it in the ""British  ; Irish"" category. The distinction they make between the two groups is inappropriate and ahistorical for Bretons.

I just think it’s interesting. From my most recent ancestors it’s obvious mine are mostly from the British Isles, but my dad always says he figured we had some German. Turns out we do have some French/German, which is not surprising given how people get around, but it’s nice to see my father’s speculation upheld.

There’s also a bit of Iberian and Nordic, which he never thought of, but like I said, people get around. And there’s a tiny bit of Japanese, probably from a single person caught up in the Portuguese slave trade of the 16th century. 

It’s not special at all, but it’s still interesting. There are genetic markers, which are like familial mutations passed along through inbreeding, that’s really what these things are about. 

Like the lactase gene, LCT, it originated as a mutation a couple of times in different places - in Northern Europe and Africa. It spread mainly from Northern Europe, but remains most concentrated there. When you find your mate from a limited area, there’s bound to be some close cousin mating from time to time, so the extended family of the LCT Nation is more closely interrelated than it is related to any population in China, say.

Lactase persistence is the continued activity of the lactase enzyme in adulthood. Since lactase's only function is the digestion of lactose in milk, in most mammal species, the activity of the enzyme is dramatically reduced after weaning. In some human populations, though, lactase persistence has recently evolved as an adaptation to the consumption of nonhuman milk and dairy products beyond infancy. The majority of people around the world remain lactase nonpersistent, and consequently are affected by varying degrees of lactose intolerance as adults.

846256,rkaplan16,2017-10-30 09:26:45,"Thanks again, very helpful!

I think one of the problems, as I understand it, is that ""mutation"" and ""variant"" are probably more mathematical definitions rather than meaning something is deleterious or beneficial, per se.

For example, the first transition in a population of 2m humans at a specific location, from an A=&gt;G, is a mutation by definition (1/2,000,000 has a G, while 1,999,999/2,000,000 have an A). This particular mutation is very beneficial to the reproduction and survival of a human. It starts to spread like wildfire. Soon, &gt;20,000 in the same population have a G instead of A, meaning &gt;1% have a, G, and therefore this location goes from a mutation to a SNP by definition. Say it keeps spreading to the point where &gt;99% of the population has a G instead of an A. This location, again, ceases to be a SNP location. The A now comprises &lt;1% of the population and so the A is considered a mutation by definition. A could be wiped out and now this is considered a ""normal"" location in the genome with nothing particularly special about it (if we didn't know its history or identify something unique about this location).

If mutation and variant (or polymorphism) are really mathematical, it would seem that all SNPs were mutation locations at some point in the past. Although this could go further down the rabbit hole of the first homo sapiens. I wonder how many differences in nucleotides we might have seen in the first 90 people. By definition at least, if there’s a transition in one letter, it’s now a SNP because &gt;1% has the “minor frequency allele.” Kind of gives me a new perspective on population expansion as I think about it. Obviously, the tighter the rope you throw around the population you're observing, the more likely you're going to consider a switch in a nucleotide as ""normal"" compared to a ""mutation.""

I think the mathematical definition (if this is really the best sense of the meaning) takes care of transitions and whether they can be mutations. Any new transition we can observe in a large population that we can only find in one (or &lt;1% of the population) person starts off as a ""mutation."" It may be that it is a ""mutation"" from a more evolutionary definition: it actually seems to be a change that makes people less fit overall. It's not likely to gain popularity (at least in the current environment). But it can also be something that works out quite well for the environment. Lactase persistence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence), for example.

I guess my question now shifts to what 23andme can and can't look at, which requires me to learn more about how they actually sequence. But if I shelf 23andme for moment and consider a company like HLI that does whole-genome sequencing, shouldn't one be able to get his data back, plug it into some software and compare it to the reference genome and look at where any bases are not lining up? So he can look at transitions or transversions? He can see that he has a T where the reference genome has an A.

So, my guess is that, sure, you can get your whole genome sequenced and line up any one of the letters on your 3 billion base pairs, so I probably need to reframe my question: are there known transversion SNPs that are reported somewhere (say, SNPedia or dbSNP)? Is there at least one rsid that reads something like:

Orientation: plus
rs5555555
Geno
(A;A)
(A;G)
(G;G)
(A;T)

Can a transversion mutation go on to exist in &gt;1% of a population and therefore become a variant and not a mutation?
